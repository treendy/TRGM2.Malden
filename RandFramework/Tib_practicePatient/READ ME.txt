This script will spawn a civilian unit with ACE wounds as a practice patient.
Use the following commandline to exec the script:

null = [POSITION, DISTANCE, MODE] execVM "Tib_practicePatient\Tib_medical.sqf";

POSITION: 	the position of an object. It will be the spawn position. 
		Use PLAYER for player. Do not use markers.  

DISTANCEL:	The Distance between the spawnposition and the patient 
		to trigger the despawn of patient. 

MODE:		1, 2 or 3;
		Mode 1 is minor injured patient. 
		Mode 2 is severe injured patient. 
		Mode 3 is patient with cardiac arrest. 

Example: null = [spawnPos, 10, 1] execVM "Tib_practicePatient\Tib_medical.sqf";

You can use this script freely as long as you give credits. 
Good luck with it and I hope it will help.
